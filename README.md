### Hi there 👋
I am a Statistician at the [Department of Enterprise, Trade & Employment](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/), on secondment from the [CSO](https://www.cso.ie/en/index.html). I use GitHub for a couple of work-related and hobby projects. My main languages are R, SAS, and more recently Stata.

#### Some projects

- 🎓 [Higher Education Outcomes](https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-heo/highereducationoutcomes-graduationyears2010-2016/) - a longitudinal study of outcomes for higher education graduates carried out using admin data.
